* :never  : does nothing (use it if you enabled client auto commit)
* :poll   : commit last read offset after processing all the items of a poll
* :record : commit the offset of every processed record

#### Multi-threading
  You can set either :threads-by-topic or :threads option (if both are set, :threads-by-topic will win)
  * :threads          : spawn N threads total (each thread listening all registered topic)
